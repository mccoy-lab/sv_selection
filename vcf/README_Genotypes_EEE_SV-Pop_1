Variant calls and the genotyping method were published in [1]. HX1 variants were called using data in [2], and AK1 variants were called using data in [3]. 

High coverage short read samples used for genotyping were obtained from 1000 Genomes (1KG) Phase 3 [4] and the Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP) [5]. 24 samples were part of the original 1KG Phase 3 effort, and 150 samples were recently sequenced to high coverage through the Polaris project (https://github.com/Illumina/Polaris). The remaining 266 samples were obtained from SGDP. The sample names in the VCF are structured using source ("1KG", "POLARIS", or "SGDP"), an underscore ("_"), and the sample name (e.g. "SGDP_HG03006").
